This is version 3.0 of mimir. If you encounter any problems
while compiling or testing mimir, do not hesitate to email me
(marcs@cs.ru.nl) and I will try and correct the problems.

Mimir makes use of the following GNU tools when compiling under
Unix:

- gcc
- make	(the GNU make, check with --version)

All of these tools are available from a large number of ftp-sites.
Indirectly, mimir also uses bison and flex. However the C code
generated by these generators is included in the distribution.

When compiling under Microsoft Windows either use MINGW/Cygwin
solution (not recommended) or compile with MS Visual C++ (See
the subdirectory msvc100 for solution and project files).

I have successfully built and tested mimir on the following
platforms:

   CPU          OS              Comment
   i686         Linux 2.4
   i686         FreeBSD 4.x	SMP
   i686		Windows7	See the msvc100 directory

                                Success, Marc Seutter
