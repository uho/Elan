This is the most recent compiler version for ELAN. It is
strictly intended for Linux/Unix. It assumes that you have
gcc installed on your computer, as it uses the compiler
driver to assemble and link. The Elan compiler can generate
assembler code for Intel x86, AMD 64, Sparc (<V9), Alpha
as well as VAX11 (not tested; anyhow who has a VAX11 still
in operation nowadays). Several runtime extensions are also
available namely the socket, experimental X11/Xaw, and
experimental thread library.

To compile the new Elan compiler, you must also download
the datastructure generator packet mimir from
ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/vb/mimir

Good luck, Marc Seutter
