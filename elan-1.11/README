This is version 1.10 of the new Elan compiler. If you encounter
any problems while compiling or testing Elan, do not hesitate
to email me (marcs@cs.ru.nl) and I will try and correct the
problems.

Elan makes use of the following GNU tools:

- gcc
- make	(the GNU make, check with --version)

All of these tools are available from a large number of ftp-sites.

It also makes use of the datastructure generator mimir,
available at ftp.cs.kun.nl:/pub/vb/mimir-2.17.tgz

I have successfully built and tested Elan on the following
platforms:

   CPU          OS              Comment
   i686         Linux 2.2.19    Slackware
   i686         Linux 2.2.10    Suse 6
   i686         Linux 2.4.5     Debian
   amd64        FreeBSD 4.4/4.6 SMP
   sparc-sun4m  Solaris 2.8
   sparc-sun4u  Solaris 2.9
   alpha        NetBSD

                                        Success, Marc Seutter
                                        (marcs@cs.ru.nl)

Note for installation on sparc: the 64 bit Sparc V9 architecture
is not yet supported.
